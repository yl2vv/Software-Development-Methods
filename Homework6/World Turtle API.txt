The API (Application programming interface, what we can tell the turtle to do)

Things you can tell a world

Command						 Action

World w = new World();				 Makes a new 600 by 600 pixel world

World w = new World(w, h, Color.Red);		 Makes a new w by h pixel with a red background

w.clearGround();				 Erases all turtle trails

w.saveAs("someImageName.png");			 Saves the current image in your project folder

Things you can tell the turtle

Command						 Action

Turtle t = new Turtle(someWorld);		 Makes a new turtle in the center of the world

Turtle t = new Turtle(world, x, y);		 Makes a new turtle at the specified point of the world

t.forward(100);					 t moves forward 100 pixels

t.backward(83);					 t moves backward 83 pixels

t.right(306);					 t rotates to its right (clockwise) 306 degrees

t.left(34);					 t rotates to its left (counter-clockwise) 34 degrees

t.setColor(Color.RED);				 t becomes a red turtle

t.pickPenUp();					 t stops leaving trails as it moves

t.setShellSize(123);				 t becomes a large turtle

t.setPenWidth(25);				 trails t leaves are now 25 pixels wide

t.dropPicture("http://example.com/logo.png, 30); t draws a picture about 30 pixels wide where it is standing

There are other methods such as t.penPenDown(), see eclipse for more.
